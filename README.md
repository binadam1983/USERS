A small project to demonstrate user registrations, logins, and logouts using Golang and MySQL, which in turn uses the following:

- Gin framework
- Uses Crypto to hash passwords before saving them to the database
- JWTs for user authentication/authorization
- MySql for database
- Custom middlewares for Logs(in JSON format using 'logrus'), CORS, and Authentication/Authorization)
